# Counter-App
A visual counter app using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript


Main features:
- three animated counters,
- scroll down and scroll up animated buttons,
- the counters run on the scroll event / clicking the scroll down button (once their position is reached),
- the counters run only once, then their values are "freezed" to the target point.
